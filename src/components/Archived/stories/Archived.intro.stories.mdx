# Archived

Helps users identify Web pages that have been archived online.

## Use When

This approach is mandatory for Government of Canada Web pages that have been archived online.

A Web page can be archived online if it is:<br/>
--maintained for reference, research or record keeping purposes;<br/>
--will not be altered or updated after the date of archiving; and<br/>
--stored in a digital repository.<br/>
Examples include; a new policy that has replaced an old policy, older versions of reports, events that have happened in the past (such as conferences).

## English pages

Add the following markup at the start of the content area of the page (after the h1)

<Canvas>
  <Archived />
</Canvas>

## Optional

Add a paragraph after the first h2 providing a link to a replacement (if one exists) and explaining why the current page was archived.

<Canvas>
  <Archived content='The <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=24227"> Standard on Web Usability </a> replaces this content. This content is archived because Common Look and Feel 2.0 Standards have been rescinded.' />
</Canvas>
